Implemention of a multi-user database application for managing the academics of an academic institute with several of the real world concepts into the application. For sake of convenience, we would be focusing on creating a command line interface to interact with the database. The functionalities to be supported are based on the academicpolicies of our institute. As you are already aware, our academic eco-system for UG programs basically consists of the following stakeholders.

    ● Students

    ● Faculty

    ● Academics Office

Command Line Interface (CLI):

    ● Each of the key entities such as student, faculty and academic office should have a menu screen to undertake their regular duties.

    ● The CLI must be interactive and must have proper navigation controls. For example, after a student registers to a course he must be returned to the screen where he must be presented with all the functionalities he can perform.

    ● Each user must be able to:

      ○ Login/logout from their accounts.

      ○ Update profile to save contact details, batch, joining date etc.


Documents submitted along with the code:

    ● Unit test plan

    ● JaCoCo code coverage report

    ● UML diagram

    ● Readme on how to compile and run the program
